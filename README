ext - display file extensions

installation:
	make
	make install

usage:
	ls | ext
	ext words.txt image.png

documentation:
	man ext

ext treats each line in its standard input as the name of a file,
and will display the apparent extension of each.

if connected to a tty, each program argument is used instead,
wherein newlines are ignored.

each file extension is written to the standard output on its own line.
files without extensions will produce empty lines.
